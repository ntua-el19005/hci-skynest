-> Size Matters
Android Large size specifications: 360x800
Size when flutter runs my device: 480,1066.7

Width from figma to flutter helper function to work in proportions

->in home_page_overlay the button "My Posts" is a good piece of code for any
"icon on left,text on right" instance


->maybe add GestureDetector around the login and register pages (as we did
  in the customize_post_page)

->Implement id instead of username in posts and anywhere else username is used

->Michael Must Make:
    saved and history
    comments and working popups to change them
    award list on db and award implementation
    settings


20/1:

///// Done button looks wrong in settins popup! done
/////Posts user made do not use the new image captured done!
-> Slide Transitions for overlays
 ///// Make your own comment implementation done!If i have time,i need to make the comment appear first on the list of comments
///Bluetooth popup done!
